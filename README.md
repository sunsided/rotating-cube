# RotatingCube

A port of [RotatingCube](https://github.com/kescherCode/RotatingCube) by Jeremy Kescher.

---

A small Rust console application to display a cube and rotate it, manually or automatically.

## Controls

- W and S rotate the cube up or down in the x-axis.
- A and D rotate the cube up or down in the y-axis.
- J and K rotate the cube up or down in the z-axis.
- Hold ALT before holding any above keys and the cube will rotate faster.
- Same goes for SHIFT, except it's going to rotate slower.
- Press M to toggle between manual (default) and automatic modes. Also note that you can't control the cube in this mode, not even with modifiers like SHIFT and ALT.
- Press ESC to exit the program at any time.

Nothing too special. Feel free to tell your friends it was yours or sell it, it's public domain!<br>
